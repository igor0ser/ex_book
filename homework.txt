I checked HW and have some comments:

 * Do not use console.log for log information.
 + It is better to use REST api to CRUD actions and sockets as events to notify other users.
 + You need to check user rights before create or delete some records.
 + You shouldn't hardcode your's application url callbackURL: 'http://localhost:8080/git/cb'
 * Do not cheat with loading comments.
